description: Detailing the specifics of options within a context is vital to meeting expectations. Here are some heuristics and lessons I've learnt doing just that. 

## The Devil is in the... options

Pretend we're sign writers commissioned to write a menu of milkshake flavours. We've received our instructions on a note.

> *The flavours are Strawberry, Chocolate, Banana and Vanilla.* 

I try to not be a pendant about many things but the presence of an [Oxford Comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) (aka. Serial Comma) in my experience creates clarity more-so than the absence thereof.

So we do our continue to write the sign as we understand the instructions.

> Milkshake Flavours:
> - Strawberry
> - Chocolate
> - Banana and Vanilla

So the milkshake shop owner receives the sign and is disappointed that the sign isn't what they expected. As there appear to be only three options on the sign:

> *The flavours are Strawberry, Chocolate, Banana, and Vanilla.*

We have to dispose of the sign we've crafted, returning to our workshop. This time we decide to take some initiative in rewriting the sign:

> Milkshake Flavours, choose one of:
> - Strawberry
> - Chocolate
> - Banana 
> - Vanilla

Again we present the sign to shop owner, who is even more upset. As now the sign reads as if it's not possible to half and half flavours.

So once more we put paint to board, and come up with:

> Milkshake Flavours, choose up to two of:
> - Strawberry
> - Chocolate
> - Banana 
> - Vanilla

We've made the sign but it look a bit of back and forth. 

## So how could we have done better?

The lack of specificity when detailing options can lead to re-work. 

The threat of having retread may lead to attempts to introduce specificity without validation, which will lead to further disappointment.

Now while this is a trite example, as the concepts (thus the *rules*) of milkshakes is one most are familiar with. If we were detailing the large hadron collider, I know I would be out of my depth. I wouldn't know any of the rules. *So what are we to do?*

Thankfully there are some heuristics to help us make better sense of our options.

## Some heuristics for describing options

- **Mandatory**, do I have to make a choice from the available options? Can I skip over the choice and still get a complete experience?
- **Cardinality**, how many options can I have at a time? Is is limited to only one choice or can I have multiple choices?
- **Repetition**, can I make multiple selections of a choice? For example chocolate compared to double chocolate? 
- **Mutual Exclusivity**, if I can have more than one option at at time, are there any combinations that are prohibited?
- **Equivalence**, how similar are the options? If there is a great variance then perhaps we need to reconsider the way we've structured the "thing" we're describing.

## Ok, but what was that tangent about Oxford Commas earlier?

Glad you asked.

## In summary

The articulation of intent informs the implementation, be it verbally or transcribed. Our prior knowledge of a domain will inform our attempts to control any ambiguity between intent and implementation. However we don't need to have domain knowledge to achieve clarity when tasked with communicating options. Rather there are some heuristics we can apply to tease out the details and achieve specificity.
