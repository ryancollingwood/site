## What is Sense Making?

Sense making could be described as the cognitive processes of an individual in order to achieve contextual self-efficacy.  That is an individual’s ability to react to sensory inputs in order to manage prospective situations, to make the perceived world more orderly (*Harvey et al. 1999; Weick, Sutcliffe & Obstfeld 2005*). Other definitions have a more immediate focus, that is the collection and organisation of data, for a represenation that fits a task specific question (*Russel et al. 1993; Sharma 2011*).

The commonality in encountered definitions is enabling action, the **“interplay of action and interpretation”** (*Weick, Sutcliffe & Obstfeld 2005*), in environments where actors are seeking clarity and routine (*Zellmer-Bruhn 2003; Balogun 2005*). This is not a rational process of comparing alternatives, but rather modifying existing understanding to work with the situation at hand (*Harvey et al. 1999; Metcalfe 2005*). *Weick, Sutcliffe & Obstfeld (2005)* refer to this as **“Noticing and Bracketing”** in which an individual determines if an unidentified event has happened before. As an individual seeks to recognise phenomena, *Metcalfe (2005)* proposes the mind **“goes through a process of jumping to conclusions”** that these conjectures are based on prior experiences. *Qu & Furnas (2005)* rather than speaking of phenomena speak of **“structure”** which is derived from a top-down deduction of previous knowledge.  

Although sense making is specific to an individual new sense making triggers are encountered as recipients interact with each other and attempt to arrive to a meaning allowing for a new routine (*Balogun 2005*). As routines are established, members become less inclined to experiment with new ways of doing things (*Zellmer-Bruhn 2003*). Supporting this, is the view that the more entrenched a language game is in a community of practise the less open it is to change (*Boland & Tenkasi 1995*). As such sense making is not only **“unavoidably subjective”** but constrained to the needs and goals of the community (*Gioia & Chittipeddi 1991*).

## Perspective Making and Perspective Taking

*Boland & Tenkasi (1995)* refer to Perspective Making and Perspective Taking. Making describes the steps taken by a community of knowing to develop its domain and practises. Taking describes the process whereby the knowledge and beliefs of another community of knowing are taken into account when interacting. However *Boland & Tenkasi (1995)* acknowledge that within a community there cannot possibly be a one to one mapping of understanding between members. As such making of a perspective involves influencing the sense making of peers towards a preferred solution. At an individual level this is reflected in the tendency to link a tentative solution to problem as we develop an appreciation thereof (*Metcalfe 2005*). In order for perspective taking to occur, the diversity of knowledge in an organisation needs to be made explicit.

In their explanation of cognitive processes undertaken, *Boland & Tenkasi (1995)* emphasise the significance of narrative to rationalise non-canonical observations. Through narrative an individual’s sense of self and placement in the world is maintained. World is not limited to the individual, but **“identity in social context of other actors”** (*Weick, Sutcliffe & Obstfeld 2005*). Perspective Making and Taking provides a view of how sense making occurs between and within communities of practice.

## Implications for Agents of Change

As previously stated explicit sense making tends to occur when there is a variance between perception and expectation of environments (*Weick, Sutcliffe & Obstfeld 2005*), or when our **“rules go wrong”** (Boland & Tenkasi 1995). Interruptions play an important role in changing organisational routines (Zellmer-Bruhn 2003) which in turn encourages sense making, however it is not necessary for change. But the presence of a **“crisis”** does provide a compelling rationale for change (*Gioia & Chittipeddi 1991*). In practise, it may be necessary to impart some kind of urgency or pressing rationale to secure involvement.

Business Analysts need to suspend prior assumptions, so that they can discover the lenses through which members interpret their experiences (*Gioia & Chittipeddi 1991*) as what is plausible for one group, may not be plausible for another (*Weick, Sutcliffe & Obstfeld 2005*). As appreciation of a situation is what is required, rather than comprehension (*Metcalfe 2005*). The implication of this for practitioners is the importance of inclusive representations and understanding and allowing for multiple narratives (*Alderman et al. 2005; Boland & Tenkasi 1995*) when developing visible representations of knowledge. However these artefacts are more than the sum of shared knowledge their value is having **“symbolic adequacy”** to facilitate conversation without imposing commonality (*Boland & Tenkasi 1995*).

However there is the risk of such an artefact to dominate member’s information seeking activities, and in turn sense making efforts.  Recipients may not feel the need to engage in further information seeking activities, or focus their energies on understanding the provided artefact (*Sharma 2011*). One explanation for this behaviour is that data extraction is a time consuming activity (*Russell et al. 1993*).

*Gioia & Chittipeddi (1991)* do put forward a model for organisational sense making that optimistically displays bottom up flows for sense making, and top down flows in sense giving along organisational hierarchy. However this model is unable to account for the shift from vertically integrated organisations, to horizontal structures with a focus of peer to peer collaboration (*Boland & Tenkasi 1995*).

Another means by which change agents could facilitate sense-making without imposition is to develop boundary conditions rather than strict rules. Which provide the space necessary for sense making in a context but still allow for some degree of control (*Balogun 2005*). Divergence along these boundary conditions is where there is a need for identification or establishment of common ground.
